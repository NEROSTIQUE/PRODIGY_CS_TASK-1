Caesar Cipher - Text Encryption and Decryption Tool 🛡️

This is a simple Python program that performs encryption and decryption using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. The Caesar Cipher is one of the oldest and simplest classical encryption techniques. It works by shifting the letters of the alphabet by a specified number of positions.

🔐 Features

Encrypt any text using a shift value
Decrypt an encrypted message using the same shift value
Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters
Non-alphabetical characters (spaces, punctuation) are preserved
User-friendly command-line interface

🧠 How It Works

Each letter in the message is shifted by a given number of positions in the alphabet.

For decryption, the same shift is applied in the reverse direction.
